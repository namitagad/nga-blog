##### Complete KYC by 25 April 2019 to retain “Active” status for your Company

Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA) is actively cleaning up its database of private and public limited companies through various initiatives. Their purpose is to eliminate shell companies and have complete & accurate information about operating companies. As a step towards achieving this, MCA has introduced Form INC-22A (also known as e-form Active; Active company tagging identities and verification) vide notification dated 22nd February 2019. An “Active” tag implies KYC compliance under the Companies Act, 2013.

Below are the highlights of e-form INC-22A:

|Sr. No|Title         |Note   |
