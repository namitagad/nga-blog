#### Save taxes by switching to Systematic Withdrawal Plan (SWP)

Mutual fund investors looking for a regular cash inflow avail of the dividend payout option especially for two reasons; earning regular income with an added advantage of tax-free dividends. Most retired persons also prefer dividend schemes over Post-Office Monthly Income Scheme (PO-MIS) because of higher and tax-free returns offered by the former. But the proposed provision of taxing dividend at 10% under the Union Budget 2018 threatens to take away the advantage of tax-free dividends from investors. The said 10% tax will make its way to Governmentâ€™s treasury by way of Dividend Distribution Tax (DDT). This means that fund houses would be responsible for depositing the tax on dividend declaration and investors will receive the money net of taxes in their bank accounts.

As you are aware, there is another [proposal for introduction of LTCG tax at 10% on the amount exceeding Rs.1Lac](https://www.namitagad.com/blog/2018/02/01/Understanding-the-proposed-Long-Term-Capital-Gains-Tax-1/). Even with these two draconian proposals (DDT & LTCG), let us see how you can save on taxes by a little tweak in your investment planning.

As mentioned, dividend option of a mutual fund works best for anyone looking for a regular cash flow. However, after passage of Finance Bill 2018, choosing a Systematic Withdrawal Plan (SWP) over dividend option can help to save taxes. 

Systematic Withdrawal Plan (SWP) is the facility by which an investor can withdraw a pre-determined amount from her existing investments in mutual funds at a pre-decided interval such as weekly, monthly, quarterly, semi-annually or annually. If you invest Rs.1Lac in 10,000 units at NAV of Rs.10 and wish to receive INR 5,000 per month, then each month equivalent units would automatically be redeemed at the prevailing NAV. Thus you will receive INR 5,000 every month on redemption of units worth INR 5,000 as on that date.

Let us assume one has invested INR 10 lakh in Dividend Mutual Funds at 1% dividend payout per month i.e. INR 120000 a year and another is having INR 120000 LTCG through SWP. What would be the tax impact in each of the cases post enactment?

|Particulars|Mutual Fund, Dividend Option|LTCG from Mutual Fund, SWP Option|
|-----------------|:----------:|:----------:|
|Income for the year|INR 120,000|INR 120,000
|Tax Rate|DDT @ 10%|LTCG Tax at 10% over INR 100,000
|Tax Amount|INR 12,000|INR 2,000

The above example is only to illustrate the tax impact and cannot be a direct comparison for investment purpose. Cash inflow under dividend plan is a mere earning and your mutual fund units are unbroken, whereas SWP is the redemption of units as per your cash flow requirement. Crux being dividend income would now have a tax burden from INR 1; while in LTCG, one can enjoy tax benefit up to INR 1 lakh.

Taxes such as LTCG and DDT will make selection of mutual fund schemes difficult because schemes cannot be selected in isolation based on the past performance and other parameters. You will have to do extra exercise each time to calculate your post-tax returns and choose the best among the available options.
